      <p className="mb-4">
        By attending HackKU 2025, you agree to abide by the following Code of
        Conduct.
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-8">
        <li className="mb-2">
          Treat all other hackers with respect. Behave kindly and
          professionally. Despite the competitive component of hackathons,
          understand that HackKU is, above all, a learning opportunity.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          Treat all organizers, sponsors, mentors, judges, volunteers, and event
          hosts with respect. Without them, HackKU would not be possible, so
          show that you appreciate them.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          Respect the University of Kansas’ facilities, as well as any others
          who may be on campus during HackKU. This event is hosted at a
          university, and you will be expected to act in accordance with the
          relevant sections of the University of Kansas Student Code.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          Food, snacks, drinks, and swag will be available for free throughout
          the weekend. Do not take more than your fair share or try to “cheat
          the system” to take more than you need.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          Harassment or discrimination based on any, or any combination of, the
          following grounds is strictly prohibited: age, religion, sex, sexual
          orientation, gender identity, gender expression, disability, race,
          ancestry, place of origin, ethnic origin, citizenship, color, age, and
          any other grounds that the law protects against. All individuals are
          entitled to a respectful and inclusive environment free from any form
          of harassment or discrimination. This policy applies to all areas of
          our operations and interactions.
