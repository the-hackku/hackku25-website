        Treat all other hackers with respect. Behave kindly and professionally.
        Despite the competitive component of hackathons, understand that HackKU
        is, above all, a learning opportunity.
      </li>
      <li class="code-item">
        Treat all organizers, sponsors, mentors, judges, volunteers, and event
        hosts with respect. Without them, HackKU would not be possible, so show
        that you appreciate them.
      </li>
      <li class="code-item">
        Respect the University of Kansas’ facilities, as well as any others who

      <li class="code-item">
        Food, snacks, drinks, and swag will be available for free throughout the
